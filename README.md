# Seq2SeqCode
Autoencoder Seq2Seq model adapted from [here](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/4%20-%20Packed%20Padded%20Sequences%2C%20Masking%2C%20Inference%20and%20BLEU.ipynb)

## Dependencies:
 - Miniconda3/Anaconda3
 - Python3
 - PyTorch
 
## Getting started
1. Clone this repo:
`git clone git@github.mit.edu:sanjas/Seq2SeqCode.git`
2. Create Conda environment:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Make sure you are cd'ed into the repo's root and run:
 ` . ./start.sh` to activate the environment and set the PYTHONPATH.
 
## Data
Make sure you set the dataset path correctly in `tools/data_load.py`. On the first run, it will take a long time (how exactly depends on the number of CPUs, since it's parallelized) for the whole dataset to be processed. Onsubsequent runs it will take less than 30 sec to load.

## Training
Run `python tools/train.py`. Some hyperameters are set in `model/hyperparams.py`.

## Testing
To see the performance on the test data run `python tools/test.py`

## Inference
Run `python tools/inference.py`
